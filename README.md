# DATA MINING: TERM DEPOSIT - USING R

The project is to use data mining techniques to perform analysis and predict whether clients will decide to subscribe the term deposit or not based on factors. Other two goals are finding a certain percentage of customers who are most likely to invest on term deposit (ranking goals), and profiling term deposit: finding out which factors are assoicated with term deposit.

Given that, we can figure out potential group of clients for term deposit products and give recommendations to increase cost efficiency for marketing campaign.

Process of Data Cleaning: Understanding data set, exploring data by visualization, Reducing data dimension (the effect of predictors on term deposit, assessing the correlation of selected variables)

Data Mining Techniques Applied: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bays Classifier for categorical predictor, Lift Chart, Decile Chart
